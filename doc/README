Libraries to install for compilation:
libgl1-mesa-dev
libglu1-mesa-dev
libpulse-dev

SpriteScene: A component that handle all sprites steps (it supports
step synchronization with other libraries like QmlBox2D)

Sprite/SpriteState: A component to handle frames and sprite states in
a step-oriented way (all sprites can be paused/resumed in sync)

PixmapText: A component to draw stylized texts, mapping chars to a
given position in a tiled image.

ParticleSystem: A simple step-oriented particle component.
ImageLoader: A dynamic image provider that is meant to be used to load
images async during loading time (basically during splash screens).

PcmSound : A low latency API to play wav files (PCM format). I know
that Qt-Mobility already provides a sound effect component that is
meant to handle that, but it's not ready for games yet due the latency
and some bugs (tested on N8 and N9). Currently, there is just a pulse
backend but others can be easily added.

RawConnection: It basically creates a C++ connection in order to avoid
binding evaluations in the QML side (it can be used for example to
sync QmlBox2D and SpriteScene steps)

Settings: This component is a copy of the Settings component present
in qt-component-desktop. It's useful to store simple information like
sound volume, mute states, etc.
